# Elm Reorderable List

A drag and drop reorderable list component for elm.

Still in progress, it works pretty nicely so far, though is undocumented and the
API might change a bit before it's released to elm-packages.

If you want to get started, check out the examples directory.


## Roadmap

These are features that I am going to try and implement soon:

- Placeholder class
- Handle
- Items that are sortable -- using selectors class / id ??
- Animation
- Snap to grid
- Restrict to container
- Axis
- Legacy browser compatibility
- Page scroll when nearing edge??
